# Configuration file for Calamares
#
# This is the top-level configuration file for Calamares.
# It specifies what modules will be used, as well as some
# overall characteristics -- is this a setup program, or
# an installer. More specific configuration is devolved
# to the branding file (for the UI) and the individual
# module configuration files (for functionality).
---
# Modules can be job modules (with different interfaces) and QtWidgets view
# modules. They could all be placed in a number of different paths.
# "modules-search" is a list of strings, each of these can either be a full
# path to a directory or the keyword "local".
#
# "local" means:
#   - modules in $LIBDIR/calamares/modules, with
#   - settings in SHARE/calamares/modules or /etc/calamares/modules.
# In debug-mode (e.g. calamares -d) "local" also adds some paths
# that make sense from inside the build-directory, so that you
# can build-and-run with the latest modules immediately.
#
# Strings other than "local" are taken as paths and interpreted
# relative to wherever Calamares is started. It is therefore **strongly**
# recommended to use only absolute paths here. This is mostly useful
# if your distro has forks of standard Calamares modules, but also
# uses some form of upstream packaging which might overwrite those
# forked modules -- then you can keep modules somewhere outside of
# the "regular" module tree.
#
#
# YAML: list of strings.
